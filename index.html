<p>With a suitable impact measure in place, we can modify the AI’s utility function as follows, where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-344">u</script> is the original utility function, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-345">\mu</script> is a tuning parameter, and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-346">R</script> is the measure of the impact: <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-347">U = u - \mu R</script>.</p>

<p>No matter what impact measure is used, the problem remains how to tune <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-348">\mu</script>. If <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-349">\mu</script> is too small, a misaligned agent is dangerous, and if <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-350">\mu</script> is too large, the agent will have no impact at all (if we’re lucky enough to have a suitably designed impact measure). The window for which <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-351">\mu</script> yields a safe agent may be quite small. Presented here is another way of relaxing the impact constraint besides simply reducing <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-352">\mu</script> which may yield a broader window of safety.</p>

<p>Suppose we are have an impact measure that deals with a comparison between two counterfactual distributions over states, one of which arises from a null policy, or the AI never having existed, or something like that, and one of which arises from an action under consideration. If we sample <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-353">s_0</script> from the first distribution over states, and we sample <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-354">s_1</script> from the second, we can write the impact measure as an expectation over <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-355">I(s_0, s_1)</script>. (In fact, most promising impact measures don’t fit this mold, but I’ll start with one of this sort. The ideas presented here can be modified for other impact measures). </p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-356">S_{possible}</script> be the set of states that are reachable from <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-357">s_1</script>. We can relax the impact in an extreme way by updating the impact measure from the expectation over <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-358">I(s_0, s_1)</script> to become the expectation over <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-359"> min_{s \in S_{possible}} I(s_0, s)</script>, again with <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-360">s_0</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-361">s_1</script> sampled from their respective distributions. The effect of this is that the agent does not need to take actions that have low impact; the agent must take actions from which we can then reach a low-impact outcome in the future. The agent must take actions that are approximately “undoable.” Indeed, if we were using this strategy, we would likely want an undo button that compelled the agent to pursue the argmin over <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-362">S_{possible}</script> of the impact and then turn off.</p>

<p>If we have in hand a measure <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-363">d(s_1, s_2)</script> for how difficult it is to reach a state <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-364">s_2</script> from <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-365">s_1</script>, we can constrain the AI further. Let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-366">S_D</script> be the set of states reachable from <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-367">s_1</script> with difficulty <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-368"><D</script>, and let the impact be the expectation over <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-369">min_{s \in S_D} I(s_0, s)</script>. With <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-370">D</script> equal to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-371">0</script>, we have the original impact measure, and as <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-372">D</script> increases, we allow the agent greater liberties, but always with the ability to return to a low impact state if need be, provided a working undo button.</p>

<p>See below for a few possible difficulty metrics that could be applied.</p>

<p>This strategy attempts to capture the intuition that many bad actions are irreversible. Saving a life is relatively easier to undo, whereas causing a death is harder to undo. No actions are truly reversible, but requiring them to be approximately reversible seems intuitively to put an upper bound on how bad it can be, even if we rarely or never press the undo button. This provides some intuition for the idea that we would not just be constantly undoing the agent’s actions in this paradigm—an action that is approximately undo-able is likelier to be acceptable to us.</p>

<h2 id="difficulty-measures">Difficulty Measures</h2>

<p>Three metrics are proposed here for measuring the difficulty of moving from one state to another (for an agent with action space <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-203">A</script>): time-difficulty, probability-difficulty, and money-difficulty.</p>

<p>Time-difficulty is the expected time it takes to move from the first state to the second, if an agent with action space <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-204">A</script> is minimizing that quantity.</p>

<p>Probability-difficulty is the likelihood that the second state is achieved within a given time interval <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-205">t</script>, if an agent with action space <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-206">A</script> is maximizing that quantity.</p>

<p>Money-difficulty can be thought of as follows: for an agent with action space <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-207">A</script> that is maximizing monetary gains, the opportunity cost of also having to get from the first state to the second state. Let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-208">s_1</script> be the first state, and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-209">s_2</script> the second. Let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-210">a_1</script> be an agent whose utility is the time-discounted dollar value in a certain account. Let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-211">u_1</script> be the expected utility that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-212">a_1</script> will recieve, if it starts in state <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-213">s_1</script>. At time <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-214">t</script>, let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-215">x_t</script> be equal to the dollar value of that certain account if the world has at some point been in state <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-216">s_2</script>, and let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-217">x_t = 0</script> otherwise. Now let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-218">a_2</script> be an agent whose utility is time-discounted value of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-219">x_t</script>. Let <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-220">u_2</script> be the expected utility that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-221">a_2</script> will recieve, if it starts in state <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-222">s_1</script>. Let the money-difficulty of moving from <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-223">s_1</script> to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-224">s_2</script> equal <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-225">u_1 – u_2</script>. In other words, if <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-226">a_2</script> has to deal with the “distraction” of having to get to state <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-227">s_2</script> as soon as possible, how much does that cost?</p></div></body>
